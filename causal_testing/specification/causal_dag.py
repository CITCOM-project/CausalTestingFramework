        computation of minimal adjustment sets for the effect of a set of treatments on a set of outcomes.

        The constructive back-door criterion is satisfied for a causal DAG G, a set of treatments X, a set of outcomes
        Y, and a set of covariates Z, if:
        (1) Z is not a descendent of any variable on a proper causal path between X and Y.
        (2) Z d-separates X and Y in the proper back-door graph relative to X and Y.

        :param treatments: A list of treatment variables that appear in the proper back-door graph.
        :param outcomes: A list of outcome variables that appear in the proper back-door graph.
        :param covariates: A list of variables that appear in the proper back-door graph that we will check against
        the constructive back-door criterion.
        :return: True or False, depending on whether the set of covariates satisfies the constructive back-door
        criterion.

    a set of treatment variables to a set of values.

    All estimators must implement the following two methods:

    1) add_modelling_assumptions: The validity of a model-assisted causal inference result depends on whether
    the modelling assumptions imposed by a model actually hold. Therefore, for each model, is important to state
    the modelling assumption upon which the validity of the results depend. To achieve this, the estimator object
    maintains a list of modelling assumptions (as strings). If a user wishes to implement their own estimator, they
    must implement this method and add all assumptions to the list of modelling assumptions.

    2) estimate_ate: All estimators must be capable of returning the average treatment effect as a minimum. That is, the
    average effect of the intervention (changing treatment from control to treated value) on the outcome of interest
    adjusted for all confounders.

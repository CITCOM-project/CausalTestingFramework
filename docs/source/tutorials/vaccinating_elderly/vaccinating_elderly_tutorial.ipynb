    "This beginner-level tutorial demonstrates the simplest way of interacting with the Causal Testing Framework (CTF), which is via the command line interface (CLI). This example provides a high-level overview of how to carry out a Systems Analysis of the Covasim framework - the epidemiological COVID-19 Agent-based Simulator ([Covasim](https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/covasim)) model that was used by the UK government to base their COVID-19 policy. Covasim is an example of a complex, non-deterministic epidemiological model with many unknown inputs, making conventional software testing approaches challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of the CTF is to employ causal inference; a family of statistical techniques that provides a way to address the challenges described above. The CTF provides a way of leveraging the tester’s domain knowledge by formalising the system’s cause–effect relationships, enabling better predictions of how changes to inputs should affect outputs without requiring large numbers of controlled tests. In this tutorial, we'll be using the CLI to test for the following systems analysis scenario produced by Covasim: prioritising the elderly for vaccination **should not** affect the maximum number of vaccinations each agent receives. The runtime Covasim data was generated with the following constraints: 50,000 agents runs, for 50 days and an infected population of 1000."

Each causal test case consists of key-value pairs representing its attributes. Simply put, in the example below, we've created a test case to test whether the treatment variable (`max_doses`) is statistically independent of the outcome variable (`cum_vaccinations`). A linear regresison estimator is employed to model the relationship, with `alpha` representing the $5\\%$ significance level ($95\\%$ confidenve level).

    "The interpretation of this finding is that the test case expected `max_doses` to have no effect on `cum_vaccinations`; however the CI does not include 0 and the test fails as there is an effect, and the independence assumption fails. Similar insights can be made by evaluating the other test results within the `causal_test_results.json` file. The `json` format of the causal test results provide a simple way for users to simply parse the outputs and carry out additional data visualisation and analysis.

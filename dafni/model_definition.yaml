  summary: A Causal Inference-Driven Software Testing Framework
  description: >
    Causal Testing is a causal inference-driven framework for functional black-box testing. 
    This framework utilises graphical causal inference (CI) techniques for the specification and functional testing of 
    software from a black-box perspective. In this framework, we use causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to express 
    the anticipated cause-effect relationships amongst the inputs and outputs of the system-under-test and the 
    supporting mathematical framework to design statistical procedures capable of making causal inferences. 
    Each causal test case focuses on the causal effect of an intervention made to the system-under test.

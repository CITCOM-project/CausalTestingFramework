Causal testing is a causal inference-driven framework for functional black-box testing. This framework utilises
graphical causal inference (CI) techniques for the specification and functional testing of software from a black-box
perspective. In this framework, we use causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to express the anticipated cause-effect
relationships amongst the inputs and outputs of the system-under-test and the supporting mathematical framework to
design statistical procedures capable of making causal inferences. Each causal test case focuses on the causal effect of
an intervention made to the system-under test. That is, a prescribed change to the input configuration of the
system-under-test that is expected to cause a change to some output(s).

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12

- Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0+ (Windows only).

To install the latest stable release of the Causal Testing Framework:

``pip install causal-testing-framework``

or if you want to install with the development packages/tools:

``pip install causal-testing-framework[dev]``

Alternatively, you can install directly via source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CITCOM-project/CausalTestingFramework
cd CausalTestingFramework
```
then to install a specific release:

```shell
git fetch --all --tags --prune
git checkout tags/<tag> -b <branch>
pip install . # For core API only
pip install -e . # For editable install, useful for development work
```
For more information on how to use the Causal Testing Framework, please refer to our [documentation](https://causal-testing-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).  

>[!NOTE]
>We recommend you use a 64 bit OS (standard in most modern machines) as we have had reports of the installation crashing on some 32 bit Debian installations.

## Usage
>[!NOTE]
> Example usage can be found in the `examples` directory.

1. To run the causal testing framework, you need some runtime data from your system, some causal test cases, and a causal DAG that specifies the expected causal relationships between the variables in your runtime data (and any other relevant variables that are _not_ recorded in the data but are known to be relevant).

2. If you do not already have causal test cases, you can convert your causal DAG to causal tests by running the following command.

```
python causal_testing/testing/metamorphic_relation.py --dag_path $PATH_TO_DAG --output_path $PATH_TO_TESTS
```

3. You can now execute your tests by running the following command.
```
python -m causal_testing --dag_path $PATH_TO_DAG --data_paths $PATH_TO_DATA --test_config $PATH_TO_TESTS --output $OUTPUT
```
The results will be saved for inspection in a JSON file located at `$OUTPUT`.
In the future, we hope to add a visualisation tool to assist with this.

1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) into your own GitHub account, and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) it to your local machine.
2. [Create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) in your forked repository. Give this branch an appropriate name, and create commits that describe the changes.
3. [Push your changes](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) to your new branch in your remote fork, compare with `CausalTestingFramework/main`, and ensure any conflicts are resolved.
4. Create a draft [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world#opening-a-pull-request) from your branch, and ensure you have [linked](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls) it to any relevant issues in your description.

We use the [unittest]() module to develop our tests and the [pytest](https://pytest.org/en/latest/) framework as our test discovery, [pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) for our code analyser, and [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) for our code formatting.
To find the other (optional) developer dependencies, please check `pyproject.toml`.
